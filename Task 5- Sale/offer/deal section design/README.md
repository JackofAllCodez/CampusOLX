After building the hero section and footer section of the home page now it’s time to add content sections to your website CampusOLX, For this task, you have to design the **SALE section/Discount section or call it the offers section** for the home page of the website. This task is for **30 points**.

CampusOLX, as the name implies, is a local online marketplace specifically designed for students at IIIT-A to buy and sell second-hand items, such as furniture, electronics, and other household goods. By providing a platform for students to sell items they no longer need or use, CampusOLX can help students save money on living expenses and make it easier for them to find affordable products. It can also be a convenient way for students to sell items they no longer need, allowing them to declutter and make some extra money. The website provides the convenience of being able to buy and sell items directly with other students on campus may make it an appealing option for students at IIIT-A.

The task needs to be done on **Figma**. Figma is free to use and doesn't need to download. It is very easy to learn and hardly takes 20 minutes to learn. If you are unclear on how to use it, check the tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&t=784s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&t=784s)

## Procedure:

1. Your task is to decide on the Sale Section of the website. It is essentially the section that tells the user what specific items are for sale on the website. **For eg: if a seller has not been able to sell his/her product for quite some time so they have reduced the price of the product. So, such products must appear in this section.**
2. Basically the cards of those products give all the necessary info like the discounted price of the product, photo of the product, name of the product, etc.
3. Add elements, colors visuals that get the user to buy items on the website. 
4. First paste the hero section that you made in task 2 and then the sale section you made in this task and the footer made in the 4th task. Make sure you submit your design in this format.
5. Finally, create your ideal Home page on a Figma file and provide its link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in the **Task 5: Offer/Sale section design** folder only.

> ✨PRO-TIP: Designing any piece of UI requires the following basic steps: firstly research similar websites’ offer/sale sections (note down the key elements the placement and the arrangement) and get familiar with those sections, secondly the wire-frame (deciding where to place which element and what all has to be placed on the page) of the home page must be done, thirdly the visual design must be given (deciding the color scheme, the font styles, weight and size, the graphics on the page) and implementing the visual design, and finally some basic touch-ups!!

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The deal/offer/sale section of the home page must look proper…like the offer sections of e-commerce websites in general. Firstly paste the hero section that you made in task 2 and then make the sale section and paste it below the hero section now paste the footer. This will slowly form the home page, note that there are tasks further that will add new sections to the home page. Pls go through the sale sections/deal of the day/offers section of different e-commerce websites and make an impressive, attractive section. Make sure to follow the color scheme and theme u have used in the hero section and footer.

> ✨PRO-TIP: You must search Figma Mirror on google and then select our frame on Figma and you would be able to see how your website would look on the screen. Take references of sizes and spacing from there. Make sure you maintain consistency in your design.
